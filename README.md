### Demo  

*Screen shared by Kulsoom with one/two browser windows. If deployed, Shreya has window open instead for chat*  

1) Introduction with team intro- Azzaam  

___________________________________________________________________________________________________  

2) App demo- Shreya, Kulsoom, Taha, Varun  

Before demo-  
have an account with each of the acc types with 1 post each (with proper tags (with common tags) and 1 should be a mashed up post, BM should have proper advertisement), with proper details, dp, bio. Create admin account too.  

During demo-  
1) Go over onboarding, welcome, Register a student account (show both window sizes), get verification code from inbox, upload proper dp and fill in bio, go to profile, upload an image, give 2 tags, upvote that post.- Kulsoom  

2) Go to libraries, show all tabs and mention BM ads everywhere, click on a pic, click on a tag, go back, click on another post, click on collaborator, go back, click on profile, go back, follow a lib, show content tags search and click on 1/2 tags to show posts.- Kulsoom  

3) Go to user search and click on an account and follow them and upvote 2 posts, go back to search and click another account and report a post.- Taha  

4) Show the feed- mention posts are from following accounts/lib, upvote a post, click on a tag, come back.- Taha  

5) Show chat- search for group and join and message ppl, Create a group and message friend to join this. Join from that account too.- Shreya  

6) Show mashup page- click on upload, upload from a profile, type text, draw and undo, save to machine. Go back to upload, upload from tag search, put a shape, and save to draft. Go to upload and take this from drafts and put a sticker on the shape and upload to profile. Give right tags and collaborators (you and user chatted with). Click on this post in profile and show. Go to setting drawer and logout. - Shreya   

7) Login page (show both window sizes), forgot password, login now. Go to settings drawer and mention pages and update details (update email address and account type), give verification code. - Kulsoom

3) Backend overview- Omar, Bhavika  
4) Achieved func and whats not done, any changes we would like to make, features to add- Alister  
5) Short conclusion- Azzaam  

## Stage 2 (if any problem with this, leave a comment here)
Report- Azzaam, Bhavika, Omar, Varun.  
Webpage- Kulsoom, Shreya  
 
### Demo
The demonstration should include:   
 
1. A **brief introduction** of who you are and your group’s company website.    
2. Each person should summarise what they have **contributed** in this stage, in a sentence or two.   
3. **High level system architecture**, so that we can see what the system components are and what software 
you are using.   
4. Demo focusing on **key features of the application**. Don’t labour over things like logging in.   
5. Include a good set of **test data**. Ideally this could have been auto-generated in some way.   
6. Mention of any **development** that has been done **which can’t be demonstrated ** but will speed up the 
remaining implementation (there might not be anything in this category).   
7. It would help if you had an **overview document** to share with your Manager, **showing your functional 
requirements and what has been achieved**. Don’t make this document too detailed (e.g., no more than a page); it 
should be easy to read.   
8. The demonstration should **not take more than 30 minutes**.   
9. Each person should take part.   
10. Members of the group should **run through the presentation** using a prepared plan of events, aimed to demonstrate the key features.   
11. There could be a little audience participation, where the Manager asks for certain features to be demonstrated. 
The Manager will not try the software directly.   
12. It’s important to **have a plan** for the demo. Prepare the examples. Ensure that you focus on the most interesting parts. Giving a demo online will be extra challenging so make sure you rehearse your demo and time yourself. At the end, there may be questions. **Be prepared to show the source code and explain how various functions of the system are implemented. **
